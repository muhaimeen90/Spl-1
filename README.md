# Rubik's Cube Solver in C++

This program inputs a 3x3 standard rubik's cube and gives out all the moves to reach the solution using beginner's method. I am currently updating the program as i go through it and i wish to implement multiple algorithms to compare and give out optimized solution to the user . 

I will be using GUI to take input from the user and will try to give out animations to show the moves eventually reaching the solved state.

Algorithms yet implemented: Beginner's method
